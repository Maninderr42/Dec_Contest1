            The <b> Beagle</b> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The <b> Beagle</b>  was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling.
             Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the <b> Beagle</b>  is the primary breed used as a detection
              dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <b> Beagle</b>  is intelligent 
              and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
